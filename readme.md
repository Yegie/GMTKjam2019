# Hexo: One Color

Made by Sergey Maltsev for the 2019 GMTK Game Jam.

Tips:  
Progress is not saved when relaunching the game.  
Every level has a solution.  
If you find yourself stuck, consider swapping to a different primary color.  
Beat 13 levels for an new gamemode, where even a diameter 5 level can be incredibly challenging.  

If you completely give up, you can press 'R' to generate a new level at the current difficulty.  
If you want to skip to a higher difficulty you can press 'S' to go up one level.
